## Key Concepts

### Two Pointer Technique
- Uses two pointers to iterate through an array
- Reduces time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n) for many problems
- Common patterns: start-end, fast-slow, sliding window

## Common Patterns

1. **Two pointers from opposite ends**
   - Example: Valid Palindrome - left pointer starts at beginning, right pointer at end
   
2. **Fast and slow pointers**
   - Used in linked list problems like cycle detection
   
3. **Multiple pointers with sorting**
   - Example: 3Sum - fix one element, use two pointers for the rest

4. **Height-based two pointers**
   - Example: Container With Most Water - maximize area between two pointers

## Solving Approach

For two pointer problems, consider:
1. Can the problem be solved by working from both ends?
2. Would sorting the input help?
3. Can we eliminate possibilities by moving pointers in a specific direction?
4. Is there an invariant that can be maintained while moving pointers?
