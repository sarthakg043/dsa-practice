## Key Concepts

### Hash Tables
- O(1) average time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup
- Used for quick lookups and avoiding nested loops
- Common implementations: HashSet, HashMap/Dictionary

### Arrays
- Contiguous memory locations
- O(1) access time with index
- Common operations: traversal, insertion, deletion, searching

## Common Patterns

1. **Using Hash Tables to avoid O(nÂ²) time complexity**
   - Example: Two Sum - use a hash map to store previously seen values
   
2. **Frequency counting**
   - Example: Valid Anagram - count occurrences of each character
   
3. **String manipulation techniques**
   - Example: Group Anagrams - use sorted strings or character counts as keys

4. **Multiple passes through an array**
   - Example: Product of Array Except Self - use prefix and suffix products

## Solving Approach

For most array and hashing problems, consider:
1. Can a hash table help avoid brute force?
2. Is sorting helpful?
3. Can the problem be solved in a single pass?
4. Is there a way to solve without extra space?
